// Do ever go to your kitchen room? YOU will see many boxes, and each box contains many Elements. not only your kitchen room, you will see your entire life many things, and each thing contain many Elements like bus, team, club, laptop, etc,
// do you get the point? what we are talking about? we are talking about js Array

// JavaScript array is an object that represents a collection of similar types of elements.


var myFriendAge = [23, 22, 24];
var friendCash = [39, 39, 59];
console.log(myFriendAge);
console.log(friendCash.length)

// array can contain Number

// array can contains String
var friendName = ['AKIB', 'SAKIN', 'RAKIB'];


var vowels =['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'];

console.log(vowels.length);

// The interesting thing is that total data can be calculated without counting

var totalNumber = [34, 35, 35 , 343, 35, 38,];
console.log(totalNumber.length);

//  Yeah, you have got the point. By .length property, you can  do this
