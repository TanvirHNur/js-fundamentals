// Today's second topic is - Conditions. Or condition. Check whether the condition is true or false today. There you can see that the condition can be checked in six ways. These are-->, <, ==,! =, <=,> = Business. These are the ones.
// <This will check if the one on the left is smaller than the one on the right
// > This will check if the one on the left side is bigger than the one on the right side
// == This will check whether the left side and the right side are equal
// ! = This will check if the left side and the right side are both unequal (different or different)
// <= This will check if the one on the left is smaller or equal to the one on the right
// > = This will check if the one on the left is bigger or equal to the one on the right
// If you understand these six things, almost half of your condition is done.
// Between two conditions:
// Having && means fulfilling both conditions. One will do the other will not. Then it will not happen.
// .. Staying means fulfilling any one of the two conditions. But you don't have to do both.
